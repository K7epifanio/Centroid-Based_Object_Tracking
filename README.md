# CENTROID TRACKING

## INTRODUCTION

Object tracking is the process of:


* Taking an initial set of object detections (such as an input set of bounding box coordinates).

* Creating a unique ID for each of the initial detections.

* And then tracking each of the objects as they move around frames in a video, maintaining the assignment of unique IDs
